Oden
====

A half done kinda working game engine for Go 

Depends on these packages: github.com/willf/bitset, github.com/robertkrimen/otto, github.com/jackyb/go-sdl2/sdl

notes
=====
* Is a entity component system framework, but really isn't
* Probably very inefficent
* There's a lot of shit comments only put there until something better is written
* Only renderSystem and ScriptSystem exists, but neither of them do anything, the fundamental for script system should be pretty easy to implement 
* Uses Otto for scripting, in other words Javascript, but will be referred to as just Otto to cause unnecessary confusion
