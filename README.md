A half done kinda working game engine for Go 

notes
=====
* The check method for objects did work but not it kinda doesn't
* There's a lot of shit comments only put there until something better is written
* Only renderSystem and ScriptSystem exists, but neither of them do anything, the fundamental for script system should be pretty easy to implement 
* Uses Otto for scripting, in other words Javascript, but will be referred to as just Otto to cause unnecessary confusion
